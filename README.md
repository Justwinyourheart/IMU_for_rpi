## 📋 Description
IMU_for_rpi offers simple and easy-to-understand C implementations for Bosch Sensortec sensors like the BMI323, BMM350, and BMP390. These sensors are commonly found on 10-axis IMU breakout boards. Our code is pure C99 and does not require any additional dependencies. It runs smoothly on any Linux system that supports I2C.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Accelerometer Support:** Measure acceleration and movement.
- **Altitude Measurement:** Determine height above sea level.
- **Barometric Pressure Monitoring:** Get real-time pressure readings.
- **Gyroscope Functionality:** Control rotational movement.
- **Compatibility:** Works on Raspberry Pi and other Linux systems with I2C.

## 💻 System Requirements
- A Linux computer (Raspberry Pi preferred)
- I2C function enabled
- Basic understanding of terminal commands (no programming knowledge required)
